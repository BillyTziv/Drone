# Quadcopter Simulation and Visual Servoing
This repository include all of my work about my diploma thesis. You will find 3 branches relevant to quadcopter modeling, Visual Servoing and of course a try to implement all those simulation with my real quadcopter model. Although, I didn' t have so much time to add comments and details, I will periodically add more, trying to achieve a full wiki page about simulating a quadcopter, its dynamic and kinematic equations and all the issues I found accross the real implementation. More information about this project can be found in my Wiki page. Lastly, I have to kindly ask two thing for those you are interest. First, respect the LICENSE of this project and secondly, I am willing to answer any issues or bugs found so, leave any issue you find and I will get back to you.
