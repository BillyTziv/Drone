# Autonomous Quadrotor Landing using Visual Servoing
A work for my diploma thesis, implemented in two phases. In the first phase a simulation of an autonomous Quadrotor Landing using Visual Servoing. This repository include all of my work about my diploma thesis. You will find 3 branches relevant to quadcopter modeling, Visual Servoing and in the second phase, a real try of that simulation with serveral issues most of which were solved. There are still some issues due to the lack of budget though.
