# Jarvis - A hybrid quadcopter v1.0

Hello there! I am Billy and in this project I am gonna try create a quadcopter from scatch. Below you can find some basic info about this repository and I hope they are usefull.

# Overview
Jarvis project is about controlling a quadcopter using Arduino board and R-PI. It provides autonomours functionallity on a DIY quadcopter.

This project has been started as my graduation paper at University of Ioannina, Department of Computer Science and Engineering. So hopefully at the end of 2015 it should be completed. Be patient and follow up.

# Contact
You can contact me at vtzivaras@gmail.com for any information. I ll be happy to have a conversation with you.

# Files
Here is a list of the files in this repository and what they are developed for

- controlfrom4sonar.ino:    Code for arduino. It stabilizes a quad using four sonar under each motor (not tested).
- simulator.mt:             Simulator code for MATLAB. It simulates the kinematics of a simple quadcopter. 
- ireadFromTX.ino

I hope you enjoy this project ^_^
