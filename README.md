This project is about building an autonomous quadcopter from scratch. I have worked almost 4 months trying to bypass some parts like the flight controller but I came up with many issues that makes it quite difficult to achieve.

So here you will find anything you need to build your own quadcopter. Hardware and software necessary to make a simple drone.

Let me inform you that this is my BSe paper at University of Ioannina, Department of Computer Science and Engineering and my supervisor is Kostantinos Vlaxos.
